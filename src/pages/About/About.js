      The Westtt team has the most experience capturing residential projects,
      but we are very interested in making content for any and all captivating
      projects and properties. We are currently based in the Chicago suburbs
      (United States), but are mobile and ready to work across the globe. As our
      name suggests, as well as the name of our parent company, Headed West, our
      focus is on projects in Southern California.
